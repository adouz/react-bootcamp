**abs**:
- you should have just converted input with Number constructor and return absolute value and not have to add all of the other statements.

**is**:
- in `is.obj` from my understanding of the exercise i think you could have just checked if the value is type of Object, even if typeof null returns an "object".

**ä½•**:
- why `n !== n && n !== n` and not just `n !== n`?


other than this everything looks good to me, and also good job on having a clean code and good paractice.
