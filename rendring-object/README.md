# Rendring Object
## Instructions
let's say we have the following object containing a user information:
```js
const user = {
    firstName: 'Elon',
    lastName: 'Musk',
    age: 49
}
```
open the file `index.js` and add the necesary code to render the following HTML into the DOM:
```html
<div>
    <h1>first name: Elon</h1>
    <h1>last name: Musk</h1>
    <h1>age: 49</h1>
</div>
```
