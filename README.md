# react-Bootcamp

## Description
<s>a bootcamp that have only exercises to learn react.js</s>

You can use an online code editor like codesandbox.io to run Your react app.

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:

index.js: represents the entry file for the entire exercise.
README.md: contains exercise instructions.

Every exercise falls into one or multiple categories of React.js main concepts or others that we think front-end developers should know!
